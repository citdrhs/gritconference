      <!-- overview of CIT -->
      <p>
        The <b>Center for Information Technology (CIT)</b> at Deep Run High School, located in Glen Allen, Virginia, is
        a highly selective specialty center for students pursuing a passion in technology. Here at the CIT, we strive to
        develop our students with both advanced technical skills and the soft skills necessary to complete real-world
        projects and to prepare them for success in all of their future endeavors. The core values that we aim to
        instill in CIT students are <b>respect</b> and <b>integrity</b>, both
        of which are highly emphasized through our rigorous curriculum and projects.
      </p>

      <!-- CIT curriculum -->
      <p>
        The CIT curriculum consists of engaging and challenging courses that allow students to go above and beyond their
        limits. These classes and our hallmark experiences lay the foundation needed to prepare students for higher
        education and careers in
        information technology. CIT Alumni regularly communicate how well prepared they were for college and beyond
        because of their courses and experiences in the CIT.

      <!-- real-world connection in CIT -->
      <p>
        Not only does the CIT provide IT/CS-specific classes, but it also provides opportunities for students to obtain
        work
        experience through internships with various community partners. One highlight of students’ experience at
        the CIT is the <b>Community Innovation Technology (CIT) projects</b>. In groups, sophomore and junior students
        work with outside organizations to complete a project that is beneficial to the community. In these three month
        projects, students create technical solutions for their clients utilizing the Scrum project management
        methodology, exposing them to the many facets of the professional world. Prior to the students’ senior
        year at the CIT, they participate in a <b>Senior Internship</b>, giving them a chance to see what an IT career
        would be like and allowing them to exercise their previously learned project management and technical skills and
        develop new professional skills as well.
      </p>

      <!-- CIT community -->
      <p>
        Finally, students and faculty in the CIT form a tight-knit community. Various events are held throughout the
        year, such as the Thanksgiving potluck and field trips, where students can get together to unwind and have fun
        as a community. Students in the CIT are also well-rounded and participate in numerous CIT-related
        extracurriculars, like Girls of CIT, and non-CIT-related extracurriculars, like Blue Cheese Robotics, marching
        band, school sports, and multiple prestigious honors societies.

        <p>"The CIT is what reinforced my love and passion for technology. Going into the center I didn’t have much
          knowledge on IT and CS but having classes like AP Computer Science Principles, IT Project Management, etc,
          taught me so much more and drove me to study more in CS. The CIT also helped me build my confidence, whether
          it
          was through group projects, joining Girls of CIT, or giving presentations. It’s definitely the reason I am who
          I’ve become and I’m so very grateful for every step I’ve taken with the center since I’ve joined." --
